My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and the disease took control of his life. Hospall was brought on near the end of my dads life and they were so caring, gentle and compassionate with my dad. When we received the phone call from Hospall saying dad was not doing well and to get there, the call was made right from Michelle and was very caring. We did not make it there in time, but Hospall was there and did not leave my dads side until he passed. I cannot put into words how comforting that was that there was someone that we know with him as he left is Hospall has been great working with my mom as she recovers from some health problems. We have been very lucky to have such kind and compassionate people from Hospall in my familes life.

He was in the comfort of our home and the care that he received was excellent. We never had to worry what caregiver would come, when that person would come, if his care would be thoughtful and caring, if he and the family would be respected, how medication or supplies would be ordered, when the doctor should be called and what to do at the end of his life. At a stressful time of life, we appreciated that we did not have the burden of worrying about the care that my husband was receiving. I would recommend Hospall to anyone who requires palliative care for a loved one.","client":"Becky Haggith"},{"content":"We knew from the first interview that we had found the right agency. Michelle questioned our parents with sensitivity and insight about their needs and wishes. The assigned caregiver, Elviz, is an excellent fit for our father. Yes, it did take several months for Dad to be completely comfortable but his personal hygiene and safety were always in capable and gentle hands. With Elviz now part of the family, our father has an advocate and our mother has a part-time driver and time to enjoy her pursuits. Erwin, the nursing supervisor, visits several times a month to check Dad's health and does his INR which is much easier than going to the clinic. As their children, we are very pleased that our parents have such honest and cheerful people to help care for them. Thank you, Hospall!","client":"The Harris Family"},{"content":"Hospall Private Home Care has been a blessing for my family, and especially for our elderly parents.

My father also requires care as he is suffering from the symptoms of a stroke, prostrate cancer, a hip replacement, diabetes and parkinson's. Since my mother is no longer able to make meals, do daily washing of clothes and look after her personal cleanliness, Hospall has been a godsend. I cannot say enough good things about the trustworthiness, kindness and dedication shown with the personal care provided. It makes it an awful lot easier for me to sleep at night, knowing that they are being very well looked after. I am sure for that very same reason my parents are also able to sleep easier.

In the last year there has been a noticeable decrease in her ability to walk on her own. She is 95 and dementia is also a big concern for us. We did not want her to go into a nursing home but rather to stay with us, her family and her beloved cat. I had to find a service that would give her the loving care her deserves and along with that, peace of mind for us. I find I get both with Hospall Private Homecare.
